<h1 style="color:#1367A7">Interlibrary Loan</h1>
<p>
When patrons need materials not held in the Mack Library collection, the Interlibrary Loan department is ready to assist.
</p>
<p>
The ILL department borrowed about 634 items last year for Mack Library patrons. It lent about 1,758 items to other libraries.
</p>
<h2 style="color:#1367A7">Contact Information</h2>
<p>
Interlibrary loan requests can be submitted using the forms linked below. For assistance with interlibrary loans, please email <a href="mailto:lschaefe@bju.edu">Lydia Schaefer</a> or call (864) 242-5100, ext. 6030 or ext. 6000.
</p>
<h2 style="color:#1367A7">Borrowing Eligibility</h2>
<p>
Bob Jones University faculty, staff, and students may obtain books not held in the Mack Library by requesting an interlibrary loan.
Non-BJU patrons who possess a community patron borrowing card may also request ILL materials.

<h2 style="color:#1367A7">Patrons from other areas desiring to borrow from BJU</h2>
<p>
As a general rule, Mack Library will not send items directly to any person who is not enrolled in a BJU distance education course. Please contact your local library for information about ILL.
</p>
<h2 style="color:#1367A7">Policies</h2>
<p>
Using OCLC's electronic system, requests are automatically routed to as many as five libraries per request. The length of time needed to receive the item can vary considerably, but patrons should be prepared to wait 10-14 days.
</p>
<p>
Patrons can request just about any type of item, although certain items may prove difficult or impossible to borrow. Examples of difficult interlibrary loan items include old and/or rare books, reference books, dissertations, microforms, newspapers, sound recordings, and CD-ROMs. Journal articles can usually be obtained via ILL. Rather than sending the actual journal, most libraries will send a photocopy of the desired article.
</p>
<p>
ILL services are available to all Mack Library patrons, including non-BJU patrons with a community borrower card.
</p>
<p>
Fee: No charge for Faculty/Staff and students. A fee of $2.50 and added charges by the lending library will be required for all other patrons. Patrons can set a maximum cost they are willing to pay.
</p>
<p>
The J.S. Mack Library lends to all academic libraries and SC public libraries at no charge. J.S. Mack Library participates in reciprocal free lending of books with SoLINE members and of journal articles with SO6 members. Non-SoLINE public libraries outside SC are requested to reimburse postage costs.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#1367A7">WARNING: Copyright Restrictions</h2>
<p>
The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies of other reproductions of copyrighted material.
</p>
<p>
Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a copy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be "used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research." If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use," that user may be liable for copyright infringement.
</p>
<p>
This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order, if in its judgment the fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.
</p>
<p>
The ILL forms are for BJU faculty, staff, students, and community patrons only. Patrons who live outside of Greenville should initiate the ILL process from their own libraries. Patrons who live in Greenville must have a community patron borrowing card.
